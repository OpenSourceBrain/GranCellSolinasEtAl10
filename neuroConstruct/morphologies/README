There are three possible ways to save morphologies in neuroConstruct projects, 2 based on a mapping from the
set of Java classes describing the cell internally in neuroConstruct and 1 based on NeuroML format:

1)  XML based Java serialisation (*.java.xml files):  a mapping to an XML file of the classes. Note: this is not any part of NeuroML.
2)  Serialised Java object form (*.java.ser files):   a serialised representation of the Java classes.
3)  NeuroML v1.8.1 format (*.nml):                    an XML representation of the morphology as a Layer 3 NeuroML v1.8.1 cell

Option 2) is quickest to load and save and the files are smaller. Options 1) and 3) however can be opened (and edited!)
with a text editor. neuroConstruct will load up any files of these 3 formats it finds in this directory, but can only
save in one format. Change which format to use via Settings -> General Properties & Project Defaults/Project properties.

*.bak files in this dir backup the previously stored morphology before a new one is saved (if a problem occurs saving a
morphology, close the application, remove the .bak from the name of the morphology file to use the previous structure
of the cell when reloading the project).
